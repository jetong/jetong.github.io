Remote Part-Time students have told us that it's tough to set aside full-day Saturdays for nine months, and we listened! And we get it! Giving up full weekends for 9 months can be tough.
For the Remote Part-Time classes starting Jun 19 and Aug 6, we will be switching from "one weeknight and full day Saturdays every week" to "two weeknights and half day Saturdays every week".
Below are the revised schedules:
RPT09:
— start:  6/19/18
— grad:   3/9/19
— schedule:  Tue/Thu 6pm - 9pm Pacific Time; Sat 9am - 2pm Pacific Time
RPT10:
— start: 8/6/18
— grad: 4/27/19
— schedule:  Mon/Wed 6pm - 9pm Pacific Time; Sat 9am - 2pm Pacific Time
